# Gifscroller
This is a fun little side project I made with html, css and javsscript. I wanted to make a fun and simple website that displays funny and random gifs that I downloaded from https://tenor.com. I was inspired to make this project when I came accross https://scrolller.com/.  
I would like incorporate an api to get the gifs instead of local.
